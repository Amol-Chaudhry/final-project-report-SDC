# Self-Driving Car

Self-driving cars are a shared ambition among Google, Tesla, Apple, Uber and Lyft, among other automotive, tech and ridesharing companies. For Uber and Lyft specifically, it's a matter of cutting costs. However, fiscal expediency is not the main benefit of this emerging technology.

Roughly 94 per cent of traffic accidents are caused by human error, and autonomous vehicles (AVs) seem to be our only path towards reducing this figure. In addition, driverless cars have other benefits, such as reduction in traffic congestion. 

Our objective for this project is to design and build an autonomous driving car that is capable of stable traversal through the self-made track with automatic control using computer vision.
## Features

- The car can detect if there is a road/track to move.
- The car can detect lanes on the road/track, and can automatically move right or left depending upon it.
- It can also detect the presence of obstacles , such as other cars, in its path. 
- It can also check for the presence of stop signs, traffic lights and act accordingly.
- It can also perform complex maneuvers such as a U-turn.
- The car can also increase and decrease its speed for smooth start and stop operation.
